The Pig and Whistle
    A small brass bell sits on a rosewood table along with a guest book.
There is no need to ring for attention, however; you are getting plenty of
that already. A brass sign assures you of the quarters' legendary comfort.
A heavy, adamantite plated prayerbook is here, collecting dust.
A pile of worn maps sits in the corner, free to adventurers.
The jailer's keys have been left here.
Assorted keys dangle from an iron loop here.

The Pig and Whistle
    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.
The Tavern owner, William Sweetwater, offers you a drink and a pie.

The Tavern Square
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.
A muscular watchman quietly patrols the streets of Port Balifor.
A merchant has erected a portable counter in the middle of the street here.

          *** PvP Tournament Postponement Announcement ***

    Due to unexpected acts of nature, the PvP tournament will need
to be rescheduled to a later date. Please keep your eyes peeled for
a future poll to set up the new time in the near future.

    Thanks for your understanding,

-Arctic Staff

December 19, 2025

                  *** PvP Tournament Announcement ***

     The immortal staff is pleased to bring news of another (PvP)
tournament! The official tournament start time will be Sunday,
December 21st 18:00 UTC in-game System Time (please check for your local
timezone).

  Details:

 [return for more, q to stop]
      - Any level 28+ player can compete in any tournament format.
      - You may bring your own gear: it will neither drop on death nor 
     frag in the arena.
     - For those that would like, a temporary set of class gear and a 
     weapon type of your choosing can be provided. This equipment will
     be taken back upon the end of the event.
     - Self-prep & group-prep spells are allowed in peaceful rooms upon
     entry to the arena.
     - No outside prep permitted. (i.e.: wands, scrolls, potions, 
     anything brewed/scribed) - Use of "orbs" is restricted. 
     - Corpses and spirits will exist in the arena.

  Sign-Ups:
     - There will be two events. 2v2, and a last man standing.
     - Please either use the Google form or message Rinad/Seeros/Attai/Ayeka
     to register your interest.
     - Google Form: https://forms.gle/w2DJybev8rUjKeEUA

  2v2 Specifics:
     - You may pick your teammate.
     - Players may register a team solely of their own characters. (Multi
     allowed.)

 [return for more, q to stop]
     - If you do not have a teammate but still would like to enter, the
     staff will attempt to pair you up with another single player
     entrant.
     - No character swaps are allowed after the tournament has started.

  Last Man Standing Specifics:
     - Only one character may be registered.
     - A round will consist of (up to) 8 characters entering, and only 1
     leaving!
     - If there is more than one round, round's winners will go compete 
     against each other for the grand prize!

     For those who do not enjoy participating in PvP, you can still
experience the excitement in real time by using the arena 'spectate'
system. Check the signage in an inn of any major city on tournament day.

     Everyone who competes in the tournament will receive something to take
away (in addition to the glory and death). Of course, the fiercest, most
talented, or most lucky gladiators will walk away with the most fabulous
prizes!

Happy Holidays! 

Gnomish toy factories are renown for mass producing toys at Christmas time
to bring happiness and joy to the children of Krynn, the most famous of
which is the legendary toy factory of Sandy Klorze.

Recently, rumors have been circulating of nefarious groups planning to
attack these facilities which, when coupled with reports of a frantic
gnomish tinkerer near the western gate of Palanthas seeking the aid of
stalwart adventurers, can only mean trouble. Or perhaps it represents
opportunity, as there will certainly be fantastic festive rewards for the
valiant heroes who save Christmas!

The seasonal Christmas instance zone has a 24-hour lockout, meaning each
character can only enter once per 24 hours. There is also a 90 minute timer
to complete an instance. The event will be available between now and New
Year's Day.

Most importantly, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all!

Gobble Gobble Gobble!

Wild turkeys have once again been unleashed on the world of Krynn. They are 
running rampant throughout the roads, forests, and mountains of the world. 
Seek out and hunt these avian menaces, but be sure to keep safe the prized 
feathers you pluck from their carcasses. Special awards (coins & equipment) 
will be given to the players who can hoard the most feathers!

99H 129V 15567X 9.60% 50C T:33 Exits:NESW> help combat
Combat is found every day by characters throughout Krynn. As you adventure,
you will come across creatures of all shapes and sizes, many of which do
not appreciate you being in their territory. To start combat with another
creature, you can simply HIT or KILL them. This will attempt to put you in
combat with your opponent, where you automatically exchange blows. As a
rule, you should always have a weapon WIELDed when you go into combat, as
you do very little melee damage without one. You may also have SKILLS or
SPELLS that allow you to hurt your opponents in combat. A skillful blow in
combat may do extra damage as a CRITICAL HIT.

If you are part of a GROUP and one of your groupmates is in combat, you can
ASSIST him to help fight the opponent. If you succeed in killing the
creature, you will generally be rewarded EXPERIENCE. As you gain experience
you will eventually rise in LEVELS and power.

If you are in combat and you seem to be losing the fight, you may need to
FLEE from it. If you just want to step away from a fight that you were
assisting in, you might RETREAT instead. If you are unable to win a fight,
it may result in DEATH for you.

Combat that is done with other players falls under the rules for PKILLING,
which can have other consequences. Certain rooms in towns also provide

 [return for more, q to stop]
protection from combat or other violence for the standard onlooker.

99H 129V 15567X 9.60% 50C T:27 Exits:NESW> help assist
Format: ASSIST <character>
    or: ASSIST

This command will cause you to assist in attacking whatever the character
is currently attacking. This is useful when in groups (so that you attack
the same monster as everyone else!). For example,
    assist Azran

will allow you to help Azran attack whatever he is attacking at that time.

If you type "assist" with no arguments it randomly selects a group member
in the room involved in combat and assists them.

Format: learn '<spell>'|<skill> ...
        learn all/everything

This command works while standing in the same room as a guildmaster.

Specifying no <spell> or <skill> will list (for each guildmaster in the room)
the spells/skills you can learn from them.

If <spell> or <skill> is specified, then that spell/skill will be learned
from the guildmaster.  You can enter multiple spells/skills to learn.
For example:
    learn kick bash backstab
    learn all

In the case of spells, the spell caster has a chance at learning the spell
from the guildmaster. If they fail, they must wait until they have advanced a
level before attempting to learn it again. Once a spell is successfully
learned, the spell is made known to the caster, but he/she must still
memorize the spell whenever they wish to cast it. Essentially, spells are
copied (using the "learn" command) into the player's "virtual spellbook"
whose contents can be listed using the "spells" command.


 [return for more, q to stop]
In the case of skills, guildmasters can simply guide you in the use of the
skill, after which the player must go out and use the skill before returning
to the guildmaster for more training.  An appropriate message as to whether
or not the guildmaster can train you further in your skill will be given if
you try to learn a skill.

Note that spells must be enclosed in single quotes (').

Specifying "all" or "everything" as an argument will make it so that you
(attempt to) learn everything you possibly can from the guildmaster.

Examples (these assume the character has learned the spells specified):
  memorize 'light' 'magic missile' -- Sets these spells to be memorized, if
                                      there are empty spell slots available.
  memorize stop 'shield'           -- Removes the 'shield' spell from your
                                      memorization queue.
  memorize stop                    -- Removes all spells from your
                                      memorization queue.

The "memorize" command is used by all spell-casters to control the spells
that they memorize and can then cast. The argument 'auto' is used to toggle
your auto-memorization flag. If the flag is on, then any spells you cast
will be placed back on the memorization list for you.

The argument 'stop' is used for stopping memorization of particular spells
or, if no spells are specified, all spells currently being memorized will

 [return for more, q to stop]
be removed from the memorization list.  You may specify a list of spells
to stop memorizing.

When you specify spells, you will begin (or stop) memorizing them.  The time
it takes to finish memorizing your spell(s) depends on which spell(s) you are
currently memorizing, the level of the spell you have just begun memorizing,
and the phase of your alignment's moon if you are a mage.  You don't have to
rest or sit to memorize although your studies will take less time in these
positions.  However, you won't memorize if you are fighting, dying or unable
to read your spellbook (for instance, if it is dark or if you are
sleeping). You may specify a list of spells to begin memorizing.

Specifying no argument will list spells you have memorized, those you are
currently memorizing, estimated time of completing your current memorization
session, and how many spells you can memorize at each spell level.  Please
note that the completion time is estimated.  Only under certain conditions
does one actually memorize spells in their memorization list, often at a time
penalty (if not resting).  Otherwise, the time does not 'advance' for the
memorization time of your list.  The output will be:

Spells currently memorized:
1: [ 1]bless                [ 1]create food          [ 1]create water

 [return for more, q to stop]
   [ 2]cure light

6: [ 1]harm                 [ 1]summon               [ 2]heal
   [ 1]word of recall
7: [ 1]animate dead

Spells on memorization list:
3: [ 1]fear

Spells left (level-number): 1-4 2-9 3-6 4-8 5-6 6-1 7-2

The numbers on the left are the spell levels.  The numbers in []'s
indicate the number of copies of that spell are being or have been memorized.

For example,
    7: [ 2]animate dead      [ 1]gate
indicates that you have 2 'animate dead' spells and 1 'gate' spell currently
memorized and both spells are level 7 spells.

This command will display the current phase of the moons when you are

Nuitari. Everyone can see the other moons, Lunitari and Solinari. The moons
can affect adventurers in various ways, and mages will find that their
memorization rates and other abilities are modified by the phases of their
respective moon. Specifically, the power of mages is greatest when their
moon is full, and weakest when it is new.

The Alignment System:

There are 10 different alignments at arctic. These alignments can be
arranged so as to form a circle of alignments. The names of some of the
alignments are very much like some of the D&D alignments. Make no
assumptions about what an alignment is based on its D&D counterpart. The
alignments can be grouped by good/neutral/evil or by
lawful/chaotic/neither(neutral). The word neutral, however, will always be
used in the context of the former grouping. The former grouping also takes
precedence over the second grouping. The good alignments are those
characters that fight for the cause of good against evil. Such characters
do not take a life lightly; they will bear the consequences of their
actions. The evil alignments indicate those who have taken up the fight
against good, and seek to destroy it. Neutral characters seek a balance of
the forces of good and evil, and so try to be balanced in their actions.
Lawful essentially means an extreme. Thus Good Lawful is an alignment which
is good in the extreme. The idea here is that the truly good, neutral, or
evil will work within the confines of their respective rule systems to
further their ultimate goal. The most evil, for example, will not kill
indiscriminately, as they will not kill those who can be useful to them (in
game terms this basically means other evil creatures) in the interests of
the struggle versus good.

 [return for more, q to stop]

Alignments affect a number of things in the game.  Some objects will or will
not be usable by certain groups.  Alignment determines the colour of a mage's
robe, and the moon with which their power fluctuates.  The experience
received from NPCs is dependent on the alignments of the combatants that
are involved.  Keep a close watch of the experience you are getting, this
will give you an idea of whether such behaviour is appropriate for somebody
of your alignment.  The good alignments are penalized the most for killing
inappropriately, and are rewarded the most for taking up their fight against
evil.  The neutral alignments will get full experience for almost any NPC
but must maintain a balance to remain neutral.  Evil alignments will get
full experience for everything but other evil mobs, but will be rewarded with
bonus experience when fighting for the cause of evil.

Here is a list of the 10 alignments:
    NC Neutral Chaotic          NL Neutral Lawful
    EC Evil Chaotic             NG Neutral Good
    EL Evil Lawful              GN Good Neutral
    EN Evil Neutral             GL Good Lawful
    NE Neutral Evil             GC Good Chaotic

You can get selected help on any of these.  For example, to get help on the

 [return for more, q to stop]
neutral chaotic alignment, you can do "help nc" or "help neutral chaotic".

THE PATH OF ALIGNMENTS

        The following diagram shows how the alignments are related to one 
another. A '<' pointing at an alignment means you need to make a positive
change (destroy evil) to move in that direction. A '>' pointing at an
alignment means you need to make a negative change (destroy good) to move
in that direction.

There are several guilds that are accepted in the world of Krynn. A guild is
like a profession or career, and each adventurer must choose a guild to whose
ideals or aims you wish to follow. Each guild has specific skills attributed
to them, and all are fundamental in successfully exploring the territory
around you and defeating the monsters you will inevitably encounter! As you
advance in experience, your guild will train you in these special abilities
that will help you in your travels.

Some guilds involve magic, while others rely on cunning and quick wit. With
the wide range of adventurers wandering the world, Krynn is used to
abnormalities and all will be accepted in most towns without kicking up too
much of a fuss.

Each guild is different to play, requiring differing strategies to bring out
the best in them. There is more detailed help available on the following
guilds:
     BARBARIAN      BLACK ROBE
     CLERIC         DARK KNIGHT
     DRUID          PALADIN
     MAGIC USER     RED ROBE

Paladins are knights in the cause of good.  They are men of combat, but live
by the ideals of righteousness, justice, honesty, piety and chivalry.  Their
obedience and fealty are sworn not to a monarch, but to a deity of good.
A Paladin must always be of good alignment. Should the paladin perform too
many evil acts against those of his beliefs, he will lose his status as a
paladin and the special skills (and spells) that he has become proficient in
will become severely weakened.  A paladin that has lost status will find it
particularly difficult to advance. It is possible for paladin status to be
regained through atonement.

The faith system (HELP FAITH) will give a paladin an indication of how he
is seen in the eyes of the Gods of Light. A paladin will notice his skills
diminishing as he fades further out of favor with the good Gods.

They have fighting skills similar to warriors in nature as well as a few
spells granted to them by their deity.  Their combined knowledge of might and
magic gives them an advantage both in and out of battle.  Paladins are
able to detect evil creatures and objects (they will see a red aura).  As
a result of their dedication to the cause of good, paladins are often better
in battle when doing battle against evil creatures.

Strength and health are important attributes for fighting.

Where the South Pier Meets the Bay
    Standing here gives you a spectacular view of the Bay of Balifor and a
great deal of its wonderous life. The Bay is also crowded with assorted
sailing ships, both small and large. As you look farther and farther away
to the west, the huge sailing vessels become nothing more than specks
fading into the line where the sea meets the heavens.

Along the South Pier
    You stand on the South Pier gazing up at the galley Fair Maiden to the
south. It rests in the water with an eerie calmness, as no one is boarding
or departing. The south pier continues to the west here towards the vast
Bay. As you ponder the fate of the Fair Maiden, your attention is drawn to
a notice posted near the edge of the pier.

The End of the South Pier
    Some of the seedier elements of the docks wander about in this area of
the docks. The presence of the men of the Watch is much higher here than
around the rest of the docks. As you look down the pier to the west, you
catch a glimpse of a huge old sailing ship, which has absolutely no traffic
going to and from it.

Dock Road and High Street

aromas. Shelved all along the walls are tiny vials and bottles filled with
clear liquids. The smell is quite intoxicating, and it makes you dizzy
momentarily. Araela seductively gestures for you to peruse through her
wares, and you cannot help but feel the urge to do so.

High Street
    You are on the main shopping street of Port Balifor. To the west you
hear shouts as the shopkeepers make their living. Traders square lies to
the east. From the north comes the heat of a furnace and the sound of
clanging metal. Heavy steel shutters to the south are the main defense of
the bank of Balifor.

Traders Square
    This is the centre and heart of Port Balifor. All around you tradesmen
banter for your custom. Their many bright and varied goods hang from wooden
stalls and mobile barrows. The smell of fresh produce fills the air,
sea-salt sweet. The hustle and bustle of people coming and going distort
your view of the many fine houses that occupy the streets that lead away
from the centre in all directions. A sign stands in the centre of the
cobbled square.

    The narrow trading street continues to the north, where it leads to the
docks that provide the town with its revenue. The cry of seabirds is
carried on the sea breeze, the occasional flash of white in the sky

where some wooden stables have been built, while to the west is a
warehouse.
