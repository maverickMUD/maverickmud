Welcome to the land of Krynn.

The Pig and Whistle
    A small brass bell sits on a rosewood table along with a guest book.
There is no need to ring for attention, however; you are getting plenty of
that already. A brass sign assures you of the quarters' legendary comfort.
A pile of worn maps sits in the corner, free to adventurers.
A beefy bouncer stands near the innkeeper, watching for trouble.
Ed, the crotchety innkeeper, stands here.

The Pig and Whistle
    You have entered the tavern of the Pig and Whistle. Unusually large, it
has a full length oak bar against the far wall. Many bottles of spirits
fill racks on the walls and beer kegs lay stacked and at the ready in the
corner. Small stools and tables encrusted with grime invite you to sit and
relax. A small staircase leads upwards to the sleeping quarters, and to the
west is a meeting room.
The Tavern owner, William Sweetwater, offers you a drink and a pie.

The Tavern Square
    Before you stands tavern square, a meeting place of many people and
races. The cobbles have been freshly washed and there is an air of
peacefulness about the drinkers wandering into the inn to the south. A dark
alley leads to the north, a cobbled lane to the west. Death row and the
executioners block lead to the east. Far to the west lies high street and
the main shops of Balifor. A big painted sign swings from an iron clasp on
the tavern wall.
A mouse scampers about, scavenging for food and avoiding feral cats.
A merchant has erected a portable counter in the middle of the street here.
